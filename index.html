		  <h3> Abstract </h3>
		    <p>	Mathematical cognition research has largely emphasized concepts that can be directly perceived or grounded in visuospatial referents. These include concrete number systems like natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers. Here, we investigate how a more abstract number system, the irrationals denoted by radical expressions like , is understood across three tasks. Performance on a magnitude comparison task suggests that people interpret irrational numbers – specifically, the radicands of radical expressions – as natural numbers. Response times and strategy self-reports during number line estimation reveal that the spatial locations of irrationals are determined by anchoring to neighboring perfect squares. Perfect squares also facilitate the evaluation of complex arithmetic expressions. These converging results align with a constellation of related anchoring phenomena spanning tasks and number systems of varying complexity. Accordingly, we propose that the task-specific recruitment of more concrete representations, formal anchoring, is an important mechanism for understanding and teaching mathematics.

			<p> How the Abstract Becomes Concrete:
			Irrational Numbers Are Anchored on Natural Numbers and Perfect Squares
			The historical development of number systems can be characterized as a gradual progression from the concrete to the abstract. Natural numbers, which denote the cardinalities of sets, were understood directly and formalized first. According to the mathematician Leopold Kronecker, “God created” this relatively concrete number system, whereas more abstract number systems like the integers, rationals, irrationals, and reals are “the work of man.” In contrast, cognitive science research emphasizes how number systems are grounded in analog magnitude representations (Moyer & Landauer, 1967). The natural numbers are thought to be grounded in directly perceptible objects and are internally represented as continuous magnitudes on a mental number line. For more abstract number systems, the necessity of mastering the associated symbol systems has been acknowledged. However, the focus is often on how these symbol systems recruit and restructure magnitude representations. Examples include incorporating the inverse relationship between positive and negative integers into the mental number line and capturing the ratio relationship between the numerators and denominators of fractions more precisely Matthews & Chesney, 2015; Varma & Schwartz, 2011.
			Comparatively little attention has been directed towards abstract mathematical concepts that are both imperceptible and incapable of being fully grounded in visuospatial referents. For such concepts, do magnitude representations continue to be heavily recruited or does notation-specific strategic processing become more essential? In this paper, we use irrational numbers as a test case to address this question. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore how familiar irrational numbers denoted by symbolic radical expressions like  are mentally represented and processed by typical adults. Our study has implications for extending theories of numerical cognition and for instructional design in mathematics education. It builds on literature concerned with how people understand natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers.</p>
