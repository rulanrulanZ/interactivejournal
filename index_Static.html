		  <h3> Introduction </h3>

		    <p>	The historical development of number systems can be characterized as a gradual progression from the concrete to the abstract. Natural numbers, which represent the number of elements in a set, were understood intuitively and formalized first. They are concrete in the sense that they represent quantities in the real world like the number of berries in one’s hand. More abstract number systems were discovered later and constructed hierarchically upon the natural numbers. The integers and rationals are still relatively concrete in the sense that they can be interpreted as corresponding to real world quantities like basement floors for integers and pie pieces for rationals. With irrational numbers like √2 and π, mathematicians discovered a truly abstract number system in the sense of lacking real-world referents or visuospatial models that build intuition. 
			</p>

			<p>For such concepts, do numerical magnitude representations continue to be heavily involved or does symbolic processing become more essential? Here, we explore the question How are irrational numbers denoted by symbolic radical expressions like √2 mentally represented and processed by typical adults? Our study has implications for extending theories of numerical cognition and guiding mathematics instruction.</p>

			<h3>Irrational</h3>
			<p>Irrational numbers, unlike the rationals, cannot be expressed as ratios of integers such that the denominator is non-zero. Their decimal expansions are infinitely long, non-repeating, and apparently random. We focus on square root expressions of the form √x. They are irrational numbers when the radicand x (number under the radical sign) is not a perfect square (e.g. √2) and natural numbers when the radicand is a perfect square (e.g. √9). In the following sections, we will collectively refer to irrational numbers and perfect squares as radical expressions because both contain the radical sign. </p>
		

			<h3>Method</h3>
			<h3>Participants</h3>
			<p>Overall, 81 undergraduate students from a large Midwestern university were recruited via flyers posted across campus. Their ages ranged from 18 to 24 years (M = 20.5, SD = 1.7). Experimental sessions spanned about 60 minutes and all participants received $12 in compensation. The protocol was approved by the local Institutional Review Board.</p>

			<h3>Design and Materials</h3>
			<p>We employed a within-subjects experimental design, with each participant completing all levels of the four tasks. See Table 1 for an overview of the design and materials.</p>

			<h3>Magnitude comparison task. </h3>
					<p>The first task was magnitude comparison and its stimuli were defined by four variables – type, distance, size, and perfect square status. The type variable refers to whether a number pair consisted of natural numbers or radical expressions. The natural number pairs formed from the combinations of 0, 1, 2, …, 9 with same-number pairs like (3,3) excluded (90 pairs). We were particularly interested in pairs where both numbers were perfect squares, like (4, 9) or (√4, √9). Hence, we included an additional copy of each of the 12 perfect square pairs in the stimulus set. In total, 102 natural number pairs were used in each of blocks 1 and 2. Participants judged the greater of two numbers in the first block and the lesser in the second block. Natural number pairs were complemented by 102 pairs of radical expressions formed in the same way from √0, √1, √2, …, √9. These pairs were used in blocks 3 and 4. Block 3 required greater judgments and block 4 required lesser judgments. Within each block, number pairs were presented in random order. Overall, there were 408 trials. Two dependent variables, accuracy and response time (RT) in milliseconds, were collected. </p>

			<h3>Number line estimation task. </h3>
			<p> The second task was number line estimation (NLE) and it included one within-subjects variable (type) with four levels – natural numbers, one-digit radicals, perfect square radicals, and two-digit radicals. In each level, participants saw 11 stimuli. The data from the smallest stimulus and the largest stimulus were not analyzed because these mapped to one of the poles of the unmarked number line (0 and 10) in all but one case. The first block consisted of the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, …, 10. The values 0 and 10 were not analyzed. The second block consisted of the one-digit radicals √0, √1, √2, …,  √10. The values √0 and √10 were not analyzed, meaning all analyzed stimuli had one-digit radicands. The third block included the perfect squares √0, √1, √4, …, √100. The values √0 and √100 were not analyzed. The fourth block included the two-digit radicals √0, √10, √20, …, √100. The values √0 and √100 were not analyzed, meaning all analyzed stimuli had two-digit radicands. These stimulus sets include one confound. The values √1, √4, and √9 are shared across two types – one-digit radicals and perfect square radicals. This was unavoidable; it was forced by the distribution of perfect squares. The 11 stimuli of each type were presented in random order within a block. There were 44 trials overall.  </p>
			<p>	Two dependent variables, average absolute error and linearity of estimates, were formed. Average absolute error was the absolute difference between a participant’s selected position and the target position. Linearity of estimates was the correlation between participants’ selected positions and target positions (R2).</p>
			<h3>Strategy questionnaire. </h3>
			<p>The third task was the strategy questionnaire for the NLE task (8 items). Participants completed a paper-and-pencil strategy questionnaire composed of two prompts for each of the four blocks – natural numbers, one-digit radicals, perfect square radicals, and two-digit radicals. All prompts were in the form “How did you decide where to place x?”, where x was a value from one of the four blocks. See Table 1 for examples. The independent variable was number type (natural numbers, one-digit radicals, perfect square radicals, and two-digit radicals) and the dependent variable was self-reported estimation strategies.</p>

			<h3>Irrationals knowledge test. </h3>
			<p>The fourth task was the irrationals knowledge test (26 items). We constructed this novel paper-and-pencil test to measure conceptual and procedural knowledge of irrational numbers. </p>
			<p>Conceptual items were distributed across three subsections. They required participants to (1) define the rational, irrational, and real number classes and classify numbers like π as either rational or irrational (8 items), (2) answer questions about the density of rational and irrational numbers (2 items), and (3) reason conceptually about the results of arithmetic operations on arbitrary rational and irrational numbers (2 items). Most of these items were in the selected response format. The procedural items were distributed over two subsections. Subsection (4) required performing simple arithmetic operations to reduce radical expressions (10 items) and subsection (5) required evaluating complex arithmetic expressions by performing operations on multiple radical expressions (7 items). These were all fill-in-the-blank items. See Table 1 for examples. Correct items earned one point each and partial credit was not awarded. Two dependent variables were computed – accuracy on each section and problem-solving strategies on subsection (5) complex arithmetic.</p>
			<h3>Procedure</h3>
			<p>After obtaining informed written consent, participants were seated alone in a quiet laboratory room in front of a Windows PC with an extended keyboard, a mouse, and a monitor. All participants completed the tasks in the same order.</p>
			<h3>Magnitude comparison task. </h3>

			<p>Participants first completed the MC task. In blocks 1 and 2 (natural numbers), they made greater and lesser comparisons, respectively. In blocks 3 and 4 (one-digit radicals), they made greater and lesser comparisons, respectively. Within each block, stimuli were presented in random order against a black background. </p>
			<p>Each trial began with a blank screen for 250 ms, after which a white fixation dot was shown in the center of the screen for 1000 milliseconds. This was followed by a blank screen for 500 milliseconds. A number pair was presented next, with each number offset about 5 centimeters on either side of the center. All numbers were displayed in white. Participants indicated the greater or lesser number by pressing the key below the target number – “Z” for the number on the left and “M” for the number on the right. The stimuli were visible until participants made a response. Feedback was provided. Correct responses were followed by Correct in green and incorrect responses by Incorrect in red. This was displayed for 500 milliseconds. Participants required about six minutes to complete each of the four blocks.</p>

			<h3>Number line estimation task and strategy questionnaire. </h3>
			<p>Next, participants completed the NLE task. They estimated the positions of natural numbers in block 1, one-digit radicals in block 2, perfect square radicals in block 3, and two-digit radicals in block 4. In each block, trials were presented randomly. Participants were told to maximize accuracy, not speed. On each trial, a natural number or radical expression was shown below a number line. These elements were shown in black on a white background. The number line was only labeled at the endpoints, zero on the left and ten on the right. The middle was left blank. Participants estimated the number’s position on the line by left-clicking with a computer mouse. To prevent them from rushing through the task, a blank screen was shown for three seconds between trials and clicks during this interval were ignored. Feedback was not provided to avoid learning effects. Overall, participants needed about six minutes to complete this task. Afterward, they were given the strategy questionnaire to complete at their own pace.</p>

			<h3>Irrationals knowledge test. </h3>
			<p>. Finally, participants completed the five sections of the irrationals knowledge test in order: (1) number concepts, (2) density concepts, (3) operation concepts, (4) simple arithmetic, and (5) complex arithmetic. Approximately 25 minutes were allotted to respond.</p>
			
			<p>Afterward, demographic information was collected, participants were debriefed, and compensated with $12 in cash.</p>
