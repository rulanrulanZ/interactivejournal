		    <p>	The historical development of number systems can be characterized as a gradual progression from the concrete to the abstract. Natural numbers, which represent the number of elements in a set, were understood intuitively and formalized first. They are concrete in the sense that they represent quantities in the real world like the number of berries in one’s hand. More abstract number systems were discovered later and constructed hierarchically upon the natural numbers. The integers and rationals are still relatively concrete in the sense that they can be interpreted as corresponding to real world quantities like basement floors for integers and pie pieces for rationals. With irrational numbers like √2 and π, mathematicians discovered a truly abstract number system in the sense of lacking real-world referents or visuospatial models that build intuition. 
			</p>

			<p>For such concepts, do numerical magnitude representations continue to be heavily involved or does symbolic processing become more essential? Here, we explore the question How are irrational numbers denoted by symbolic radical expressions like √2 mentally represented and processed by typical adults? Our study has implications for extending theories of numerical cognition and guiding mathematics instruction.</p>
